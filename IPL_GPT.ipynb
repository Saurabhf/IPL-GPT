Winning toss and electing to field first, RR bowlers maintained a chokehold on the RCB batters from the word go. Though Virat Kohli achieved that magnificent milestone of becoming first-ever player to get 8,000 runs in the history of IPL, RCB were not able to get as many runs on the board. Both Kohli and Faf Du Plessis fell cheaply and Rajat Patidar and Cameron Green couldnt give the much-needed acceleration. Not a single player managed to score a fifty showing the sheer dominance of RR bowlers. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up two wickets in an over whereas Trent Boult and Yuzvendra Chahal picked up one wicket each. Avesh Khan emerged as the most successful bowler as he picked up three wickets. But he conceded 44 runs in his spell. Rajat Patidar 34 off 22 was the top-scorer for RCB.

CSK defeat RCB by 6 wickets Rajasthan Royals vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru Live Score, IPL 2024 Eliminator: Rajasthan Royals chase After restricting RCB to a 172, RR had a solid start with Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Yashasvi Jaiswal laying the foundation. After Lockie Ferguson got the breakthrough wicket of Tom Kohler-Cadmore, RR saw a fall of wickets in the 9th, 10th and 14th over. But this didnt dampen the spirits of RR and the chase remains firmly on track. Shimron Hetmyer has come as an impact sub. Known for classic hard-hitting, Hetmyer can finish the job rather quickly. While Virat Kohli made history by becoming the first batter to score 8000 runs, RCB still had a bit of hard luck in qualifying for the first Eliminator round. Riyan Parag got the last run after Rovman Powell hit four twice in the 18th over. While RCB fans hoped for a plot twist with two consecutive wickets, RR proved themselves again.

Winning toss and electing to field first, RR bowlers maintained a chokehold on the RCB batters from the word go. Though Virat Kohli achieved that magnificent milestone of becoming first-ever player to get 8,000 runs in the history of IPL, RCB were not able to get as many runs on the board. Both Kohli and Faf Du Plessis fell cheaply and Rajat Patidar and Cameron Green couldnt give the much-needed acceleration. Not a single player managed to score a fifty showing the sheer dominance of RR bowlers. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up two wickets in an over whereas Trent Boult and Yuzvendra Chahal picked up one wicket each. Avesh Khan emerged as the most successful bowler as he picked up three wickets. But he conceded 44 runs in his spell. Rajat Patidar 34 off 22 was the top-scorer for RCB.

CSK defeat RCB by 6 wickets Rajasthan Royals vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru Live Score, IPL 2024 Eliminator: Rajasthan Royals chase After restricting RCB to a 172, RR had a solid start with Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Yashasvi Jaiswal laying the foundation. After Lockie Ferguson got the breakthrough wicket of Tom Kohler-Cadmore, RR saw a fall of wickets in the 9th, 10th and 14th over. But this didnt dampen the spirits of RR and the chase remains firmly on track. Shimron Hetmyer has come as an impact sub. Known for classic hard-hitting, Hetmyer can finish the job rather quickly. While Virat Kohli made history by becoming the first batter to score 8000 runs, RCB still had a bit of hard luck in qualifying for the first Eliminator round. Riyan Parag got the last run after Rovman Powell hit four twice in the 18th over. While RCB fans hoped for a plot twist with two consecutive wickets, RR proved themselves again.

            "Rajasthan Royals vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru Highlights, IPL 2024 Eliminator: Rajasthan Royals have been the best bowling side in this edition of Indian Premier League and tonight, they are living up to that image. Winning toss and electing to field first, RR bowlers maintained a chokehold on the RCB batters from the word go. Though Virat Kohli achieved that magnificent milestone of becoming first-ever player to get 8,000 runs in the history of IPL, RCB were not able to get as many runs on the board. Both Kohli and Faf Du Plessis fell cheaply and Rajat Patidar and Cameron Green couldnt give the much-needed acceleration. Not a single player managed to score a fifty showing the sheer dominance of RR bowlers. Ravichandran Ashwin picked up two wickets in an over whereas Trent Boult and Yuzvendra Chahal picked up one wicket each. Avesh Khan emerged as the most successful bowler as he picked up three wickets. But he conceded 44 runs in his spell. Rajat Patidar 34 off 22 was the top-scorer for RCB.

After Lockie Ferguson got the breakthrough wicket of Tom Kohler-Cadmore, RR saw a fall of wickets in the 9th, 10th and 14th over. But this didnt dampen the spirits of RR and the chase remains firmly on track. Shimron Hetmyer has come as an impact sub. Known for classic hard-hitting, Hetmyer can finish the job rather quickly. While Virat Kohli made history by becoming the first batter to score 8000 runs, RCB still had a bit of hard luck in qualifying for the first Eliminator round. Riyan Parag got the last run after Rovman Powell hit four twice in the 18th over. While RCB fans hoped for a plot twist with two consecutive wickets, RR proved themselves again.
