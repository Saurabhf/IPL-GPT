# IPL-GPT 2024
This repository features an end-to-end notebook showcasing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using Azure and Azure OpenAI, alongside Pinecone for efficient embedding storage. The model leverages data from the IPL 2024 qualifier rounds and final match, integrating advanced retrieval and generation capabilities to offer contextual insights.

Key Features:

Azure Configuration: Deployed on Azure with Azure OpenAI for natural language generation.
Pinecone Vector DB: Utilizes Pinecone for storing embeddings, ensuring efficient and scalable retrieval.
Cricket Data: Focuses on IPL 2024 qualifier and final match statistics.
Evaluation:
The model's performance was evaluated using the Rouge metric, achieving a RougeL score of 0.60 for generated responses.
